### Critical Advice

1. Avoid outdated tutorials (pre-2022). Hooks changed everything.
2. Learn TypeScript early — 95% of new React jobs require it.
3. Build, don’t just watch — muscle memory > theory.
4. Master debugging: React DevTools, `console.log`, error boundaries.
5. Focus on concepts, not libraries:

   * State management → then learn Zustand
   * Data fetching → then learn TanStack Query
6. Contribute to open source: fix a docs typo → small bug → feature.
